IMPORTANT INFORMATION

I will be delivering seven topic:

1.  Corporate Financial Management.
2.  Corporate Reporting.
3.  Financial Accounting.
4.  Management Accounting.
5.  Bookkeeping.
6.  Auditing.
7.  Taxation.

All the files in this is:

1.  The Index (this is effectively the Homepage, which has an independent css file).
2.  The Home (this is effectively the Homepage of each topic, which also has an independent css file).
3   The Material (this is effectively the Teaching Element, which has an independent css file too).

Each topic has multiple sub-topics based on how I was taught it, therefore, we will see many html files.
It's important that these remain outside of a file and strictly in the root. This allows for placement
into Github (where this PWA is hosted for free). Each sub-topic is listed as "MOD" with a numerical element attached.

The independent css files are:

1.  index.css
2.  home.css
3.  material.css
